DataPower CLI using exec command

CLI, exec, XMI are all separate capabilities of DataPower. CLI is a command line
approach using a terminal connection to the DataPower. When you use exec, this is
also command line, it runs a script that calls lines of CLI.
XMI is different, and does not call CLI, but has its own SOAP (XML) format that
can create, modify, delete, get info about objects on the DataPower.
The later exercise, though, shows how XMI can also remotely call an exec script.

This extra exercise is intended to make you more comfortable with using various
capabilities and commands of DataPower. Each stage is meant to be tried out
individually, and overall to make you more self-sufficient in various DataPower
activities in combination.

A - Using CLI to delete a file
Create a file 'my-file.txt' on your workstation (any content).
Using the WebGUI, upload the file to 'default' domain 'local://' folder.
Using the WebGUI, open up that file to confirm it has your content, then close.
Open a terminal window and ssh to the DataPower, and go into configuration mode.
List the files in the 'local:///' folder:
    dir local:
Display contents of the file:
  show file local:///my-file.txt
Delete the file:
  del local:///my-file.txt
You have now seen how to delete a file using CLI.

B - Using a script file to delete a file and put an entry on the default-log
Create a script file 'delete-my-file.cfg' on your workstation with content:
  del local:///my-file.txt
  test logging file critic "Deleted file myfile.txt"
Above 'file' is the logging category, 'critic' is the event priority.
Using the WebGUI, upload the two files 'my-file.txt', 'delete-my-file.cfg' 
to 'default' domain 'local://' folder.
Open a terminal window and ssh to the DataPower again.
Check the two files are in the 'default' domain in the 'local:///' folder.
  dir local:
Now run the script file using the CLI:
  exec local:///delete-my-file.cfg
Check the file 'my-file.txt' has been deleted.
Check that entry has been made to 'default-log':
  show logging default-log file
Also view that same entry using the WebGUI.

A later exercise will show how you can use an XMI (SOAP) message from an
external system (e.g. your workstation) to call a CLI script file that is
already on DataPower.
