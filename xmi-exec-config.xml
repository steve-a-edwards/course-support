<!--
This is an XMI file named xmi-exec-config.xml and will be created on your workstation.
When sent as an XMI (SOAP) message to a DataPower, this will trigger a CLI exec file.
On DataPower, in the 'default' domain, there exists:
- a CLI script file: local:///delete-my-file.cfg
- a file local:///my-file.txt (with some arbitrary content for this exercise)
Follow the earlier exercise 'DataPower CLI using exec command' to create these files.
When run, the CLI exec script deletes the file named: local:///my-file.txt.
Here is the content of DataPower file local:///delete-my-file.cfg:
  del local:///my-file.txt
  test logging file critic "Deleted file myfile.txt"
Can be run from a workstation with curl (but using relevant user, password and dp_ip values):
  curl -k -u admin:admin-password -d @xmi-exec-config.xml https://dp_ip:5550/service/mgmt/current
