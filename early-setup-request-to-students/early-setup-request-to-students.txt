Hi Ertugrul, Mike, Patric,

Hello, this is Steve Edwards, your instructor for the course next week.
(WE761, 28th Feb to 2nd March 2022).

Hope you are all doing well, and not too distracted by recent events!
Here are some suggestions to help us all get off to a smoother start.

Summary:
1 - Reply immediately to this email so we have communications
2 - Access your e-Book and check you can locate some specific pages
3 - Send a text message to my mobile phone
4 - Register and login to GTT (GoToTraining) before the start of the
    first session (early Monday morning)
5 - Start time on the first day

Details:

1 - Reply immediately to this email so we have communications
 I'm recommending this so that:
 - I know you have received this email and my suggestion to access the
   book and specific pages (see images below)
 - if needed, we can use email as a last resort throughout the course

2 - Access your e-Book and check you can locate some specific pages
 Before the start of the course (the sooner the better) download the
 e-Book and check you can easily locate:
 - "Course Guide Administration of IBM DataPower Gateway V7.6"
   the document that has pages corresponding to the presentation slides
   and the first page 
 - "Course Exercises Guide Administration of IBM DataPower Gateway V7.6"
   the document that has the course exercises (lab) instructions
   and the first page
You should have your information to allow you to access your e-Book already
(ebook code).

3 - Send a text message to my mobile phone
Please do this when you have done the above. This will also provide a
backup way of communicating in case of any internet problems during the
running of the course.
My work mobile: +44 (0)7513890221.

4 - Register and login to GTT (GoToTraining) before the start of the
    first session (early Monday morning)
GTT is the platform that allows us to run the course remotely (similar
to Zoom or Microsoft Teams).

5 - Start time on the first day
There are students from Sweden and the UK (on different time zones), so
I suggest on the first day we start at 09:15GMT / 10:15CET, and ideally
by that time you will have completed navigating around the course books
and logged in to GTT!

Have a great weekend!
Steve
