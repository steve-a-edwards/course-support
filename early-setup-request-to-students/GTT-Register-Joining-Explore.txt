From Steve - GTT Registration / Joining / Exploration
=====================================================

Please do all of the below before the formal start of the course at:
09:15 GMT - 10:15 CET today.

Ensure you have registered for GTT (hopefully you have done this already).
GTT (= GoTo Training) is software we will use on the course to allow
for showing of presentations, talking, access to course resources, etc.
(GTT is similar to Zoom / Microsoft Teams, but with features that are
especially useful for training.)

Join the GTT session by clicking the "Join" button in a subsequent email:
"Reminder: WE751 - ...".

This should take you to a browser which will bring up an intervening page
that allows you to test your audio, and when you have finished that, click
the button that allows you to progress to the web version of the online
training.

A web page will appear, the main part on the left will be used for the
instructor to display presentations, give demonstrations, etc.
The column on the right:
- Switch to desktop version
- Audio
- Hand raising
- Attendees
- Chat
- Materials *
- Settings

Click on "Materials", and you will see a number of entries.
Click on the link "Link to file with Steve's support materials"
this will take you to a file which Steve has provided to assist you
in progressing through the course.
Have a brief browse through the contents and make a note of
what you see.

Please answer the questions in the first slide so that I know
that we are all ready to go!

See / talk soon!
