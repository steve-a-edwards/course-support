Familiarisation with the course facilities before 09:30 on the first day:

IBM Labs: WE751G
- start both of VMs:
  - A - 'Student Image' (Ubuntu desktop image)
  - B - 'Appliance - DO NOT login' (DataPower image)
- double-click 'A - Student Image' after it becomes green and click the
  arrow to get it running
- on the Ubuntu desktop, open the file '2-Ubuntu-Access-Verification.txt'
  you will see what sport Steve plays, note this ***

DataPower
- in the Ubuntu desktop open Firefox and click the 'DataPower Gateway' button
- login to DataPower 'student01' / 'student01' selecting domain 'default'
  (you will change the password, remember the new one!)
- open up the DataPower 'File Management', view the file 'local:///3-DataPower-Access-Verification.txt'
  you will see the name of the town I live in, note this ***
  
MS Teams
- it is presumed you are now able to access MS Teams
- there should be a chat entry that shows my favourite color


***Now you will have accessed the main facilities of the course, to prove this, send an email to Steve
to show that you know:
- my sport
- my town
- my favourite colour

The intention is that you can do all of the above before we formally start on Tuesday 09:30.

I will be logged in to MS Teams at 09:00 in case you need help before then.

Cheers,
Steve
